# ðŸ”€ Push Swap

**Push Swap** is a sorting algorithm visualizer project from the **42 Abu Dhabi Core Curriculum**.  
You must sort a list of integers using **only a limited set of stack operations** on two stacks `A` and `B`, as efficiently as possible.

In this implementation, a **non-recursive Quick Sort-based strategy** is used to plan the optimal sequence of moves â€” reaching **100% score**.

## ðŸ§© About

> The challenge: **Sort integers using only push, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate.**

You are given:
- Stack `A`: a list of unsorted integers
- Stack `B`: initially empty

You must **sort stack A** in ascending order **with the fewest operations** possible using only:
