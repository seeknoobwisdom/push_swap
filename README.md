# push_swap
push_swap is a sorting algorithm project from the 42 curriculum. It takes a list of integers and sorts them using only stack operations (push, swap, rotate, reverse rotate) on two stacks â€” A and B. The goal is to sort the list with the fewest possible moves, using only allowed operations and no standard sorting functions.
